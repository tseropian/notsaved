## Hello and welcome to my site :-)

My name is Thomas, I'm a (French & Lebanese) [software engineer](https://seropian.io) based in London, UK. 

I've started to build my first homepage on Geocities (I sadly lost my Neighbourhood id). Then ran a couple of heavy metal bands fansites as a teenager, which pushed me to learn the first basics of PHP and MySQL . This put me on the web development track as a computer science student, when most of our courses were still traditional old school programming (C++, J2EE, Lisp).

I've then been writing a lot, especially when I spend [20 months in Armenia (in 2006/2007)](https://www.followtheway.info/category/armenia/), then on various [musical blogs](https://freshnewsound.org). 
A habit I've then lost while focusing on building websites for others ([a private social network for families](http://hellotipi.com), a [wide range](https://web.archive.org/web/20140418140844/http://awards.earthjournalism.org:80/content/multi-platform-social-voting-how-we-did-it ) [of journalists from developing countries](https://internews.org), [a major international cooking chef](https://www.jamieoliver.com), and more recently apps for [a startup in the med-tech field](https://www.skin-analytics.com) ), instead of my own. 
A habit I'm trying to get back to with this blog.

## Can we get in touch?
[Drop me a line](mailto: thomas AT seropian DOT io) at anytime, I'm usually quite fast to reply :-)

If you're passing by London, we can even meet for coffee. I love coffee.
