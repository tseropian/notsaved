I document here what my life currently looks like. See [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com) to learn about the concept. 

## 2025-11-05

My first `nownownow` entry. I am still looking for my way here.

### Work
Been freelancing for about 6 weeks now, until the end of the year. I am working for a big corporation but at least I'm discovering Web3 and crypto world. I am also spending some time trying to figure out what 2026 will look like. 

### Geek
I have been reviving my infamous [`Echochamber`](https://notsaved.org/tags/echochamber-ai/) project. Expect some blog posts and release later this month.

### Life
Parenthood has been an fascinating experience so far (who would have thought so?). We are steadily finding our rythm. I've been taking more film photos lately to capture the little one. However, my music consumption has been completely disrupted. I'm hoping to get back on my music newsletter at some point soon.
