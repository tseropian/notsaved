Still learning how to manage my "One Thing I Learned everyday" process. I could talk about some important matters I discovered today, but it's friday evening and I'm joining friends later so I'll write about beer.
As you know I love beer (and heavy metal)![trooper_beer.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/static/images/trooper_beer.jpg)

Here are a couple of things I learnt on beer recently.

- Brewdog has opened a [share plan](https://www.brewdog.com/equityforpunks).
- For the occasion, they are [publishing recipies](https://www.brewdog.com/lowdown/blog/diy-dog) for all its beer on their website.
- A Beer Wave of 388,000 Gallons (or 1.4m L) [flooded London in 1814](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/what-really-happened-in-the-london-beer-flood-200-years-ago-9796096.html) after a huge vat ruptured.
- [White House Honey Ale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Honey_Ale) is bnrewed at the White house since 2011 upon request of Barack Obama.
- A [quite comprehensive map](http://londonist.com/2015/02/mapped-londons-breweries-and-brewpubs-by-borough) of micro breweries in London.
