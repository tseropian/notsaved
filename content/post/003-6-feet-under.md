I'm a big fan of documentaries.

One of the recent ones I've been watching lately is the 15 billion the 3 parts BBC one about [~~Crossrail~~ Elizabeth line](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/23/crossrail-named-elizabeth-line-honour-of-the-queen). 3 episodes for a total of 3 hours on this astonishing and engineering work under a living (and buzzing) city. Breath-taking.
It makes you feel quite humble about your day-to-day work and want to switch to civil engineering almost immediatly :-) I am always tempted to imagine what would a building look like if it has been design with the same approach and rigourness than what some of developers of our sector would.

Some interesting bits I learnt about the tunnels boring machines (TBM).

* [8 TBM have worked on the whole Crossrail line](http://www.crossrail.co.uk/construction/tunnelling/meet-our-giant-tunnelling-machines/). They all have women names.
* [The very first tunnel under a river was dug in London (The Thames Tunnel)](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-epic-struggle-to-tunnel-under-the-thames-14638810/?no-ist). It has been finished in 1864 after 16 years of work. It was used by pedestrians and is now part of the Overground line between Shadwell and Rotherithe.
* This tunnel used for the first time a [tunnelling shield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnelling_shield) : a cage, with 32 workers excavating the ground.
* Another XIXth century tunnel, [Connaught tunnel](http://www.crossrail.co.uk/sustainability/archaeology/archaeology-at-connaught-tunnel), as been reused for the Cross Rail.
