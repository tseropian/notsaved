title: 006 : End To End Encryption in 10 minutes
type: post
---
Earlier this year, I've been asked to explain how end-to-end encryption is working for a non-technical audience (think of computer litterate people who do not know that much of geek stuff outside or their MSOffice package). The only constrain was time (10 minutes maximum).
That was very interesting experience and brought great prompt for more discussions. I thought the presentation support could be of interest for someone else.
Here is it, on Slideshare.
