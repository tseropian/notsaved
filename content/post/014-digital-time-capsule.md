### 1. Introduction
I have been making websites since high school in the late 90s. I learnt to write HTML code on my father's old laptop (I even retrieved the tutorial I followed). I created my first page on [Geocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities) (I sadly lost my Neighbourhood ID).

I'm telling you here about a time that those under twenty cannot know—no CMS. No frameworks. No CSS. No responsive design. No Javascript bullshit :-) We were literally writing HTML code with Notepad and uploading files one by one using FTP.

I continued at university and started building some fan sites for the heavy metal bands I was following. That's when I also learned PHP and MySQL. Big shoutout to Free.fr (the French ISP that provided 100Mb storage hosting with a MySQL database for free—unheard of at the time).

I then focused most of my studies and projects on learning and improving my skills to land my first job as a web developer.

### 2. The Archaeological Dig: Technical Process
The main issue is that I lost most of my backups due to a hard drive crash in 2007 (in the pre-cloud-backups era).

My most recent websites were still living on an old web hosting service, but anything pre-2004 is definitely gone. So for this exercise to be interesting, 

I would definitely have to retrieve them from the Wayback Machine (WBM).
Finally having some time off in between jobs, I finally rolled up my sleeves.

I used a [Ruby CLI tool](https://github.com/StrawberryMaster/wayback-machine-downloader) with a bit of [elbow grease](https://github.com/StrawberryMaster/wayback-machine-downloader?tab=readme-ov-file#ssl-certificate-errors) to get the raw files from the WBM API.

Once the downloads complete, you will have a folder with all the raw files in timestamp-formatted folders. A small bash script helps you to merge all files into a single root folder.

All your files will be named as served by the original website (in my case `filename.php?id_news=1234`, or even `index.php3?lang=1`). I will host these archives on a static hosting (likely Github Pages) so I renamed all the files in `.html` (so it can be served by the hosting) and update the links in the matching files.

All your files will be named as served by the original website (in my case `filename.php?id_news=1234`, or, worst, `index.php3?lang=1`), so I renamed all the files to .html  and updated the links in the matching files.

I started manually but quickly got bored, so thanks, Claude Code, for the work.
UTF-8 wasn't a thing in the early 2000s, so I also tried to correct as many broken special characters as possible.

I ended up with one folder per website, which I then uploaded to a GitHub repo 
that will serve the sites on GitHub Pages. I also backed up on my NAS for posterity. 

That's 13 folders, which you can browse in Section 5.

### 3. What I Unearthed: Discoveries and Limitations
The process has some limitations, which, I believe, are linked to WBM's scraping mechanism.

My very first websites used iframes, and they weren't very well supported (who would have thought so?).

Some pages were missing (not a lot), and some images as well (mostly the ones displayed in CSS, mainly the ones designed for popups in the 2003/4 era).
But overall, I revived a substantial enough sample of my web development history, especially in my early years. 

These archives are [available online](http://archives.followtheway.info). I have warned you: they haven't aged well :-).


### 4. Reflections: A Conversation with My Younger Self
Reviving these websites ended up being much more emotional than I imagined it to be :-) It brought the 20-year-old Thomas to my mind. 

Learning something completely new (ie HTML) the hard way, with my browser and my Notepad. Creating a website for the carefree joy and pleasure of it, publishing it and sharing on [music online forums](https://www.freshnewsound.org/p/this-weeks-playlist-63-guest-feature) for the complete fun of it and receiving emails from strangers. What seems now very normal was completely wild at the time.

Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy writing code and building websites a lot (that's why I work [on side projects](https://notsaved.org/2022/01/01/010-on-side-projects/) from time to time), but the sheer joy and excitement at that time was of a complete different magnitude to now. The Internet was an almost uncharted territory—a complete jump out of my (non-existent at the time) comfort zone.

A gentle reminder for 2025 Thomas to get work on some uncharted territory comfort zone as well. And create something he's proud of, entirely out of disinterest. I shall dig out [this AI project I worked on](https://notsaved.org/tags/echochamber-ai/) 2 years ago.


### 5. Experience It Yourself
To save you some time, I prepared a small `TL;DR` screenshot selection.

* [Link #1, 2000](/images/thoomis.png): My 2nd website ever (after the lost Geocities mini site)
* [Link #2, 2001](/images/pwb1.png): `2001`, My first fan site (Devin Townsend) 
* [Link #3, 2002](/images/c2m1.png): Another fan site (Mass Hysteria)
* [Link #4, 2003](/images/pwb3.png): The third iteration of my Devin Townsend fansite.
* [Link #5, 2004](/images/pwb4.png): Probably one of the designs I'm the most proud of to this day :-).
* [Link #6, 2005](/images/cla.png): 1st personal homepage I've built.
