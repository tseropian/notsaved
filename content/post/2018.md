2018 is starting with as much changes as 2017 (well at least [the blog is not moving host](https://notsaved.org/2017/), I'm still happy with AWS). Lots of moving pieces on the personal and professional side too (as expected, my Chromebook [is now taking the dust](https://notsaved.org/007--chromebooks/) :-)). 

I'm now head of engineering for a startup, working at the intersection of artificial intelligence and health technologies. We are building deep learning applications for skin cancer research and I'm in charge of all our end-user apps.

It's quite a change from my work with NGOs and supportnig hostile envifonments journalists to [embrace digital security](https://notsaved.org/001--harden-your-systems/) and [encryption](https://notsaved.org/006--end-to-end-encryption-in-10-minutes/) which makes the challenges even more exciting.

Technology wise, we are full stack Javascript so I'm learning a lot of things here, especially playing with React and React Native (I'll write about it later).

However, long story short, I've been neglecting this blog too much and I want to get back to writing more regularly this year. I don't care about the audience at all but I want to do it mostly for myself to push me documenting my life (both on the personal & technical side). 

I'll try to commit to a bi-weekly / monthly post to start with with the goal to manage to make it weekly.

See you in 2 weeks then.
