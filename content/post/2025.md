20 months later, this blog returns to life.

A lot has happened since we last spoke: I found a job and lost it. So, being in between contracts, I'm back on my blog.

Expect some more posts in the next couple of months.

On the tech side, I'm making a couple of changes as well. It's still generated by Hugo and running on AWS (S3). I migrated the generation to GitHub Actions, and I have started using [PagesCMS](https://pagescms.org) to write articles.

I've also added [archive](/archive) and [tags](https://notsaved.org/tags/) pages and made some light refreshes on the theme.

I finally took some time to dust [my side projects](https://notsaved.org/2022/01/01/010-on-side-projects/) as well.

That's it for now. Speak to you soon.
