20 months later, this blogs returns to life. 

A lot happened since we last spoke: I found a job and lost it. So being in between contract, I'm back on my blog. Expect some more posts in the next couple of months. 

On the tech side, I'm making a couple of changes on this blog as well. It's still generated by Hugo and running on AWS (S3). I migrated the generation on Github Actions and I have started to use PagesCMS to write articles.

I've also added an [archive](/archive) page and made some light refreshes on the theme.

I finally took some time to dust [my side projects](https://notsaved.org/2022/01/01/010-on-side-projects/) as well. 

Speak to you soon.
