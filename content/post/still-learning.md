Am still playing with Hugo. A couple of things I'm trying to implement.

-  Continuous integration setup with Wercker. 
-  Better integration with Prose.
-  So we are reaching a complete cloud based setup (Prose + Wercker + Github)
-  More to come very soon (I will write a final post when I am happy with my setup)
-  Test1
